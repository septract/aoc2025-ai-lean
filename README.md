# Advent of Code 2025 - Formally Verified Solutions in Lean 4

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) written in Lean 4, with formal proofs of correctness.

## About This Repository

This repository contains solutions that are **AI-generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)**. Each solution includes:

- A **formal specification** that mathematically defines the problem
- An **efficient implementation** that computes the answer
- A **correctness proof** showing the implementation matches the specification

## Important Disclaimer

**These solutions are AI-generated and may contain errors.** While the Lean compiler verifies that proofs type-check, this does not guarantee:

- The specification correctly captures the problem intent
- The parsing handles all edge cases
- There are no logical errors in problem interpretation

Use these solutions for learning and reference, but verify independently if correctness matters for your use case.

## Building

```bash
# Build all solutions (proofs are checked at compile time)
lake build

# Check a specific file
lake env lean Aoc2025/Aoc01-1.lean
```

## Structure

Each solution file contains:
1. **Spec namespace** - Mathematical definition (obviously correct by inspection)
2. **Impl namespace** - Efficient implementation
3. **Proof namespace** - Proof that `Impl.solve = Spec.solve`
